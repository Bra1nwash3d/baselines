# Baselines DNC branch for PPO2

This branch adds the [Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC)](https://github.com/deepmind/dnc) to some Baselines algorithms, as well as some saving and plotting logic.

It is actually the second branch (first one is named dnc), as a new branch was easier than resolving merge conflicts after
some major master branch changes.


#### Requires
- The DNC code must be linked in the project settings or PYTHONPATH,
- matplotlib and pandas for plotting
